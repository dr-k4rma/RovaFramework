# RovaFramework
Rova, or "Roblox Java" is a framework/library manager that is designed to make lua look (and behave) like Java... Or at least that was the original idea.

Since then, Rova has changed to focus more on the framework and library manager parts of the equation, and to focus less on the 'looking like Java' part.
